# terraform-live-project

### Milestone 1:
1. Download and install Terraform.
   - [x] installing [`tfenv`](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) to switch between different versions of terraform 
  
2. Set up an AWS account.
   - [x] using my existing account in us-east-1

3. Setup up a Billing Alarm.
    - [ ] planning on implementing that in terraform after creation of a new user

4. Create a new user and give it administrator privileges. 

    Nah... the new user will just get a few necessary policies to get going with this project. No need to make him an admin. 

5. Verify Terraform Set up.
   - [ ] check via the console that proper resources have been created.

6. Write a tf script to create a new user, set up billing alarm and create a t2.small instance in your local region.
